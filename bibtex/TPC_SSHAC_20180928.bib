abstract = {Using velocity profiles from sites in Japan, California, Turkey, and Europe, we find that the time-averaged shear-wave velocity to 30 m (VS30), used as a proxy for site amplification in recent ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs) and building codes, is strongly correlated with average velocities to depths less than 30 m (VSz, with z being the averaging depth). The correlations for sites in Japan (corresponding to the KiK-net network) show that VS30 is systematically larger for a given VSz than for profiles from the other regions. The difference largely results from the placement of the KiK-net station locations on rock and rocklike sites, whereas stations in the other regions are generally placed in urban areas underlain by sediments. Using the KiK-net velocity profiles, we provide equations relating VS30 to VSz for z ranging from 5 to 29 m in 1-m increments. These equations (and those for California velocity profiles given in Boore, 2004b) can be used to estimate VS30 from VSz for sites in which velocity profiles do not extend to 30 m. The scatter of the residuals decreases with depth, but, even for an averaging depth of 5 m, a variation in logVS30 of ±1 standard deviation maps into less than a 20{\%} uncertainty in ground motions given by recent GMPEs at short periods. The sensitivity of the ground motions to VS30 uncertainty is considerably larger at long periods (but is less than a factor of 1.2 for averaging depths greater than about 20 m). We also find that VS30 is correlated with VSz for z as great as 400 m for sites of the KiK-net network, providing some justification for using VS30 as a site-response variable for predicting ground motions at periods for which the wavelengths far exceed 30 m.},

abstract = {This short note contains two contributions related to deriving depthdependent velocity and density models for use in computing generic crustal amplifications. The first contribution is a method for interpolating two velocity profiles to obtain a third profile with a time-averaged velocity V(Z) to depth Z that is equal to a specified value (e.g., for shear-wave velocity VS, VS(Z) = 760 m/s for Z = 30 m, in which the subscript S has been added to indicate that the average is for shear-wave velocities). The second contribution is a procedure for obtaining densities from VS. The first contribution is used to extend and revise the Boore and Joyner (1997) generic rock VS model, for which VS(30 m) = 618 m/s, to a model with the more common VS(30 m) = 760 m/s. This new model is then used with the densities from the second contribution to compute crustal amplifications for a generic site with VS(30 m) = 760 m/s. {\textcopyright} 2016, Seismological Society of America.

In addition, data from more than 1.5 times as many earthquakes, compared to previous pan-European models, have been used, leading to regressions based on approximately twice as many records in total. The metadata of these records have been carefully compiled and reappraised in recent European projects. These improvements lead to more robust ground-motion prediction equations than have previously been published for shallow (focal depths less than 30 km) crustal earthquakes in Europe and the Middle East. We conclude with suggestions for the application of the equations to seismic hazard assessments in Europe and the Middle East within a logic-tree framework to capture epistemic uncertainty.},

abstract = {The Cascadia megathrust subduction zone located of f o f th e coas t o f northern California, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia is a significant contributor to the overall seismic hazard for the Pacific Northwest. During the last ten years, the knowledge and understanding of the tectonics, geometry, and other important seismic source characterization parameters have been refined and incorporated into seismic hazard evaluations in the region (Frankel et al., 2002). In addition, empiri- cal ground motion attenuation models for subduction earthquakes have been enhanced based on the recently recorded 1999 Satsop (M 5.8) and 2001 Nisqually (M 6.8) intraslab earthquakes associated with the Cascadia subduction zone and additional world-wide subduction zone data that has been collected recently (e.g., Atkinson and Boore, 2003). As the database of ground motion and site classifica- tion information continues to increase, attenuation models are being developed for more specific site classification s (e.g., NEHrP site classifications) than the previ- ously used broad bins of generic rock and soil sites. Gregor et al. (2002) previously developed a response spectral attenuation relationship for cascadia subduction zone megathrust earthquakes (M 8{\~{}}9) for two generic site conditions: soft rock and deep soil. This cascadia region specific attenuation model was based on the regression of simulated stochastic finite-fault ground motions and included the modeling variability estimated from the validation of the stochastic finite-fault model for subduction zone earthquakes. This update to the Gregor et al. (2002) model improves the site classification scheme of rock or soil by including the non- linear soil response model developed as part of the PEEr NGA project (Walling and abrahamson, 2006). This non-linear soil response model is defined in terms of the peak ground acceleration on rock and the average shear wave velocity in the top 30 meters (Vs30m). With this updated model, ground motions from Cascadia subduction zone megathurst earthquakes can be estimated for a range of Vs30m values rather than the generic rock or soil site classification used in the previous model. This updated Cascadia subduction zone attenuation relationship offers an alternative attenuation model that can be used in a logic tree approach for seismic hazard evaluations in the Pacific Northwest.},

The equations were derived from a global database with M 3.0–7.9 events. We derived equations for the primary M- and distance-dependence of the IMs after fixing the VS30-based nonlinear site term from a parallel NGA-West 2 study. We then evaluated additional effects using mixed effects residuals analysis, which revealed no trends with source depth over the M range of interest, indistinct Class 1 and 2 event IMs, and basin depth effects that increase and decrease long-period IMs for depths larger and smaller, respectively, than means from regional VS30-depth relations. Our aleatory variability model captures decreasing between-event variability with M, as well as within-event variability that increases or decreases with M depending on period, increases with distance, and decreases for soft sites.},

In contrast, the peak accelerations on the footwall are not significantly different from the median attenuation over this distance range.

The relationships were developed by regression analysis using a random effects regression model that addresses criticism of earlier regression analyses of subduction zone earthquake motions. We find that the rate of attenuation of peak motions from subduction zone earthquakes is lower than that for shallow crustal earthquakes in active tectonic areas. This difference is significant primarily for very large earthquakes. The peak motions increase with earthquake depth and intraslab earthquakes produce peak motions that are about 50 percent larger than interface earthquakes.},

They provide new unambiguous definitions of site classes and rigorous empirical estimates of site‐dependent amplification factors in terms of mean shear‐wave velocity. A simple four‐step methodology for estimating site‐dependent response spectra is specified herein. Alternative techniques and commentary are presented for each step to facilitate application of the methodology for different purposes. Justification for the methodology is provided in terms of definitions for the new site classes and derivations of simple empirical equations for amplification as a function of mean shear‐wave velocity and input ground‐motion level. These new results provide a rigorous framework for improving estimates of site‐dependent response spectra for design, site‐dependent building‐code provisions, and predictive maps of strong ground shaking for purposes of earthquake hazard mitigation.},
